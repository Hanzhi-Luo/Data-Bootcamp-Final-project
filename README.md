# Data-Bootcamp-Final-project
A final project for course data bootcamp
1.Introduction
This project builds a predictive model to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to evaluate the performance of a simple classification model on a real-world medical dataset.

2.Data Description
The dataset is provided by the sklearn library and contains numerical features computed from digitized images of breast mass samples. The target variable indicates whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

3.Models and Methods
We performed exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and class balance. The dataset was split into training and testing sets. Logistic Regression was used as the primary classification model, and model performance was evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

4.Results and Interpretation
The Logistic Regression model achieved high accuracy on the test set, indicating strong predictive performance. The confusion matrix shows that most tumors were correctly classified, with relatively few misclassifications.

5.Conclusion and Next Steps
This project demonstrates that a simple Logistic Regression model can effectively classify breast cancer data. Future work could include feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or experimenting with additional classification models.
